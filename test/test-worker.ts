// --- Migration bootstrap ---
// Apply D1 schema migrations on first request. Necessary because miniflare's
// D1 starts empty and our routes (e.g. /v1/memory_stores) hit memory tables.
// Idempotent: every CREATE uses IF NOT EXISTS, drop is a no-op rerun.
//
// MUST mirror the on-disk migration list at apps/main/migrations/. Add new
// rows here whenever a migration is added; missing rows surface as
// "no such column" / "no such table" errors at runtime. Order is
// lexicographic-by-filename — what wrangler does in prod.
