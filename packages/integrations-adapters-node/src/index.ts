// Node sibling of integrations-adapters-cf. Same port shapes; storage moves
// from D1Database to SqlClient, so the adapters work against better-sqlite3
// (single-instance) and pg-postgres (multi-replica) without further changes.
//
// Shared primitives (crypto/hmac/jwt/clock/ids/http) are duplicated rather
// than re-exported from -adapters-cf, because that package depends on
// @cloudflare/workers-types via its D1 imports — pulling it in here would
// drag CF types into Node consumers. The crypto/hmac/jwt code is just
// Web Crypto + global fetch, both available in Node 20+.
