/**
 * Production TenantDbProvider: reads `tenant_shard` from the control-plane
 * DB to look up which D1 binding holds a tenant's data.
 *
 * Resolution rules:
 *   1. Cache hit → return cached D1Database (no control-plane round-trip)
 *   2. Cache miss → SELECT binding_name FROM tenant_shard WHERE tenant_id=?
 *   3. Row found → env[binding_name] (cache it)
 *   4. No row    → env.MAIN_DB (cache the fallback too)
 *
 * Cache strategy: per-isolate Map, never expires. Justification:
 *   - tenant→binding mapping is monotonic in normal operation (we only ever
 *     INSERT, never UPDATE, in the auto-assign path)
 *   - admin migrate-tenant ops are rare + manual + require worker restart
 *     (or `/admin/cache/flush` in a future enhancement) to take effect
 *   - never-expiring cache keeps hot path zero-cost after first hit
 *
 * The fallback to env.MAIN_DB is what makes N=1 deployments seamless: when
 * tenant_shard is empty, every tenant resolves to MAIN_DB, behaviour is
 * identical to the pre-sharding shared-DB world.
