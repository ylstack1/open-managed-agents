/**
 * Compose agent.system + platform guidance + optional platform reminders
 * (skills / memory_prompts / appendable_prompts).
 *
 * Reminders are appended to the system prompt instead of broadcast as
 * `<system-reminder>` user.message events. The legacy approach
 * leaked the raw skill bodies into the visible conversation feed and
 * the event log — operators correctly objected that skill content is
 * static-per-session context and belongs in the system prompt where
 * Claude already knows to treat it as such.
 *
 * Each reminder is wrapped in an XML-ish `<source name="…">…</source>`
 * block so the model still has a structural cue about where each chunk
 * came from (matching Anthropic's scratchpad / source convention) and so
 * downstream consumers can grep the prompt for a specific skill.
 *
 * If the agent has no system prompt of its own AND no reminders, the
 * guidance alone becomes the system prompt.
