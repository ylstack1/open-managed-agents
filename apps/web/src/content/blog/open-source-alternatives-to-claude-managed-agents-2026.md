Claude Managed Agents is the cleanest hosted-agent product on the
market right now. The trade-off is the obvious one: closed source,
hosted-only, no BYOK, no self-host story, no way to inspect what the
agent loop is actually doing on a hard turn.

If those constraints are blockers — for compliance, cost, vendor risk,
or just the engineer's instinct that the loop should be readable code —
this post walks through the real open-source alternatives shipping in
2026, what each one is good at, and what's still missing.

## What "alternative" means

There's a crowded landscape of open-source projects with the word
"agent" in the README. Most of them are either:

1. **A framework** for writing agents (LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen,
   CrewAI) — gives you primitives to build a loop, you operate the
   infrastructure.
2. **A hosted product** with a free tier, not actually open-source.
3. **A demo** wired to a single model with no production story.

What Anthropic ships is none of these. It's a **managed platform** — an
HTTP API where you POST agent definitions and sessions, the platform
runs the loop, persists state, isolates code in sandboxes, and streams
events back. The bar for an "alternative" should be the same: full
platform, not a framework you assemble yourself.

By that bar, the list is short.

## Open Managed Agents

[github.com/open-ma/open-managed-agents](https://github.com/open-ma/open-managed-agents)
· Apache 2.0 · 2026-04 first release

The most direct alternative — built explicitly to mirror Anthropic's
Managed Agents API and runtime model, with the source open and the
deployment under your control.

| | |
|---|---|
| API surface | Drop-in compatible with `/v1/agents` and `/v1/sessions` |
| Sandbox | Cloudflare Containers, LocalSubprocess, E2B, Daytona, BoxRun |
| Storage | Cloudflare DO + R2, or Postgres + S3 |
| BYOK | Yes — Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, custom OpenAI-compatible |
| Custom harness | Yes — write your own loop |
| Integrations | Linear, Slack, GitHub, Lark |
| Hosted option | openma.dev (subscription, BYOK) |
| Self-host | `docker compose up`, or `wrangler deploy` |

What it's good at: feature parity with the closed product on the
critical paths. Crash recovery, event log, sandbox isolation, MCP, are
all there. The harness is explicit and replaceable, so you can ship
custom context engineering without leaving the platform.

What's still in flight: detection coverage for some less-common LLM
providers, the Postgres adapter is newer than the Cloudflare adapter
and has fewer hours in production. See [the technical
comparison](/blog/claude-managed-agents-vs-open-managed-agents/) for
the side-by-side.

## LangGraph (LangChain)

[github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
· MIT

LangGraph is a state-machine framework for orchestrating agent loops.
LangSmith adds observability; LangGraph Cloud is the hosted runtime.

| | |
|---|---|
| Open-source scope | Framework + runtime |
| API surface | Custom — not Managed Agents-shaped |
| Sandbox | Not built-in; bring your own |
| BYOK | Native |
| Custom loop | Yes — that's the whole product |
| Hosted option | LangGraph Cloud (paid) |
| Self-host | LangGraph Cloud Self-Hosted (license required) |

What it's good at: orchestrating multi-step graphs of LLM calls and
tools with explicit state machines. Strong observability via LangSmith.
Mature ecosystem.

What it's not: a managed platform with a sandbox, vault, integration
adapters, and a billing-ready Console. You build that yourself.
Self-hosting the runtime requires a paid license tier — the OSS
framework is permissive, but the production runtime isn't.

If the constraint is "I want to write agent loops as graphs and ship
them on something hosted," this is a strong fit. If it's "I want a
managed platform I can deploy myself," it's a partial answer.

## Microsoft AutoGen

[github.com/microsoft/autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) ·
CC-BY 4.0

AutoGen is a multi-agent conversation framework. The thesis is that
complex problems are best solved by multiple specialized agents talking
to each other.

| | |
|---|---|
| Open-source scope | Framework |
| API surface | Python library |
| Sandbox | Optional code-execution adapter |
| BYOK | Native |
| Custom loop | Yes |
| Hosted option | None (Azure AI Foundry has an AutoGen runtime) |
| Self-host | DIY |

What it's good at: research and experimentation with multi-agent
patterns. Strong Microsoft Research backing.

What it's not: a hosted platform. AutoGen Studio is a developer UI;
AutoGen the framework is what you embed. Production deployment is
entirely on you, including state persistence, crash recovery, sandbox
choice, and the operator UI. The recent v0.4+ rewrite improved the
runtime story but it's still framework-shaped, not platform-shaped.

## CrewAI

[github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) ·
MIT

CrewAI is another multi-agent framework, biased toward role-based
orchestration ("a researcher agent and a writer agent collaborating").

| | |
|---|---|
| Open-source scope | Framework |
| API surface | Python library |
| Sandbox | Optional |
| BYOK | Native |
| Hosted option | CrewAI Enterprise (paid) |
| Self-host | DIY for the framework |

Same shape of trade-off as AutoGen: framework-first, hosted-platform
features behind a paid Enterprise tier. The framework itself is
ergonomic and well-documented for the role-based agent use case.

## What about LiteLLM, Inference Gateway, etc.

These are upstream of agent platforms — they're proxies in front of LLM
providers. Useful for BYOK scenarios, but they don't run an agent loop.
You'd combine them with a framework or platform; they're not an
alternative on their own.

## What no one ships yet (the gaps)

The honest read is that the open-source space hasn't caught up to the
closed product on a few axes:

1. **First-party workspace integrations.** Open Managed Agents ships
   Linear, Slack, GitHub, Lark adapters. The frameworks above leave
   this as an exercise.
2. **Edge deployment.** Cloudflare-native runtimes are rare in the
   open-source list — most projects assume a long-running container,
   which doesn't compose well with Workers' execution model.
3. **Vault/credential isolation as a first-class feature.** The
   frameworks expect you to handle this in your own code; the closed
   product handles it for you. Open Managed Agents' encrypted vaults
   are designed to match the closed product's behavior.
4. **A finished operator Console.** Most open-source agent projects
   ship a developer-focused UI; few have a Console aimed at operators
   who need to triage a stuck session at 3am.

## How to choose

Ask three questions:

1. **Do you need a managed platform, or do you want to build one?**
   Frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI) require you to assemble
   the platform. Platforms (Open Managed Agents, hosted Claude Managed
   Agents) give you one.

2. **Is BYOK + cost separation important?** All open-source options
   support BYOK by definition (you're the one calling the model). The
   hosted Claude Managed Agents offering doesn't.

3. **Do you need self-host, or is a hosted runtime acceptable?** Open
   Managed Agents and the framework projects support self-host. Some
   "open-source" projects gate self-host behind a paid license tier
   — read the license carefully.

If your answer is "I want a self-hostable, drop-in compatible
alternative to Claude Managed Agents," there's currently one
project that fits all three constraints. If your answer is "I want a
framework I'll wrap myself," LangGraph and AutoGen are mature picks.

## Try Open Managed Agents

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-ma/open-managed-agents
cd open-managed-agents
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Then point your Anthropic SDK at `http://localhost:8787` and your
existing client code works.
